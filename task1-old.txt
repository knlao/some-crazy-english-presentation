The bar chart shows the proportion of UK students and international students achieving second class degrees or higher in seven different subjects at a university in the UK.



Degree results were generally good for both home and international students, with well over 50 per cent gaining a second-class degree or better in all seven subjects except International Law.

International students tended to do better than UK students in technology-related subjects.

This was particularly true of Information Technology.

Whereas over 80 per cent of international students gained a good degree in IT, only about half of the UK students did so.



Degree results were similar for the two groups in Nursing and Accounting.

In Arts and Social Science-related subjects, UK students tended to do better.

The biggest gap in performance was in International Law, where three-quarters of UK students gained a second class degree or better.

In contrast, fewer than half of the international students attained this level.



Overall, the chart suggests that international and UK students had different strengths when studying for degrees in this UK university.
