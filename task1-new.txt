The provided bar chart illustrates the comparative attainment rates of second-class degrees or higher among UK students and international students across seven distinct subjects at a UK university.



Overall, the academic performance of both domestic and international students was commendable, with a significant majority exceeding the 50% mark in securing second-class degrees or above across all subjects, barring International Law.

Notably, international students demonstrated a comparative strength in technology-focused disciplines, notably Information Technology.

Conversely, parity was observed between the two cohorts in the fields of Nursing and Accounting.

In Arts and Social Science domains, UK students exhibited a tendency towards higher achievement levels.

The most pronounced discrepancy in performance surfaced within International Law, where a substantial 75% of UK students obtained second-class degrees or higher, contrasting with less than half of the international students achieving a similar standard.



In essence, the data presented in the chart underscores the diverse academic strengths of international and UK students pursuing degrees at this UK-based institution.
